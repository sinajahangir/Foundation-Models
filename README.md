# üåç Foundation Models for Environmental Modeling

This repository provides hands-on examples and workflows demonstrating the application of **foundation models** (FMs) for environmental forecasting tasks. The focus is on models like [**TimesFM**](https://github.com/google-research/timesfm) developed by Google Research, which enable general-purpose time series modeling across diverse domains.

Currently, the repository includes a **Colab notebook** showcasing how to apply **TimesFM** to a real-world **flood forecasting** problem.


## üß† What is TimesFM?

TimesFM is a foundation model for time series forecasting, designed to:
- Generalize across multiple tasks with minimal fine-tuning
- Leverage large-scale datasets to transfer knowledge to low-data environments
- Provide uncertainty-aware predictions

## üìà Example Use Case: Flood Forecasting

The included notebook demonstrates:
- Applying TimesFM to forecast the river stage and discharge forecasting
- Visualizing model predictions vs. observed data

This example showcases how FMs like TimesFM can be rapidly adapted for critical environmental challenges.

## üîÆ Planned Additions

- Notebooks using other foundation models for hydrometerology
- Multi-task training and transfer learning strategies
